  caveats <<~EOS
    Lensjet is not notarized by Apple yet, so macOS blocks the first launch
    ("Apple could not verify ...").
    Open System Settings > Privacy & Security, scroll to Security, click "Open Anyway"
    next to Lensjet and confirm. This is needed once.
    Or, in Terminal: xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Lensjet.app
